# Character Activity Rules
The types of actions a character can perform during play are most commonly classified as either a `simple action` or a `Maneuver` (complex action).
## Simple Actions
Normal movement and routine activities such as breathing, eating, walking, climbing stairs, drawing a weapon, etc. are simple actions that **do not require any rolls to resolve** (the player simply states what he intends his character to do).

## Maneuvers
An action performed by a character that entails an element of risk, or requires complex movement, unusual concentration, or thought under pressure is called a `Maneuver` and requires a `Maneuver Roll` to resolve its outcome.

When a player indicates that they want their character to attempt a Maneuver as their action:
1. GM assigns any applicable modifiers to the maneuver.
2. The character decides whether or not to perform the maneuver.
3. If he decides to perform the maneuver, an open-ended 1d100 roll is made, adding appropriate bonus along with any other applicable modifications.
4. A result is obtained by applying the modified roll to the appropriate chart.

### Static Maneuver
Any complex or unusual activity not involving significant physical movement (tracking, picking locks, disarming traps, security bypassing, hiding, astrogation, repairs, equipment operation, perception, influencing other characters, etc.).

**Repair**, **Construction** and **Research** tasks are an unusual variety of `Maneuver` â€” the character can never quite be certain how long they take until he is at least partially finished.
