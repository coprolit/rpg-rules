### Dice rolling conventions
`Open-ended roll`: **1d100** roll that can yield a result lower than 01 or higher than 100.
A roll under **06** calls for a second roll to be made and subtracted from the first.
A roll over **95** calls for a second roll to be made and added to the first.

`Modifier`: **bonus** or **penalty** which is applied to the dice roll, _e.g. skill bonuses,
stat bonuses, difficulty levels, and miscellaneous modifiers applied to the situation_.

`Maneuver roll`: modified `Open-ended roll`. To resolve the roll, the result is applied to an appropriate chart.

# Character Activity Rules
The type of action a character can perform during play are most commonly classified as either a `simple action` or a `Maneuver` (complex action).

`simple actions` are normal movement and routine activities such as breathing, eating, walking, climbing stairs, drawing a weapon, etc. are simple actions that **do not require any rolls to resolve** (the player simply states what he intends his character to do).

## Maneuvers
An action performed by a character that entails an element of risk, or requires complex movement, unusual concentration, or thought under pressure is called a `Maneuver` and requires a `Maneuver Roll` to resolve its outcome.

When a player indicates that they want their character to attempt a `Maneuver` as their action:
1. GM assigns any applicable modifiers to the maneuver.
2. The character decides whether or not to perform the maneuver.
3. If he decides to perform the maneuver, an `open-ended roll` is made, adding appropriate bonus along with any other applicable modifications.
4. A result is obtained by applying the modified roll to the appropriate chart.

### Static Maneuver
Any complex or unusual activity not involving significant physical movement (tracking, picking locks, disarming traps, security bypassing, hiding, astrogation, repairs, equipment operation, perception, influencing other characters, etc.).

**Repair**, **Construction** and **Research** tasks are an unusual variety of `Maneuver` â€” the character can never quite be certain how long they take until he is at least partially finished.
