### Some Dice rolling conventions
`Open-ended roll`: **1d100** roll that can yield a result lower than 01 or higher than 100.
A roll under **06** calls for a second roll to be made and subtracted from the first.
A roll over **95** calls for a second roll to be made and added to the first.

`Modifier`: **bonus** or **penalty** which is applied to the dice roll, _e.g. skill bonuses,
stat bonuses, difficulty levels, and miscellaneous modifiers applied to the situation_.

`Maneuver roll`: modified `Open-ended roll`. To resolve the roll, the result is applied to an appropriate chart.

# Character Activity Rules
The type of action a character can perform during play are most commonly classified as either a `simple action` or a `Maneuver` (complex action).

`simple actions` are normal movement and routine activities such as breathing, eating, walking, climbing stairs, drawing a weapon, etc. that **do not require any rolls to resolve** (the player simply states what he intends his character to do).

## Maneuvers
An action performed by a character that entails an element of risk, or requires complex movement, unusual concentration, or thought under pressure is called a `Maneuver` and requires a `Maneuver Roll` to resolve its outcome.

When a player indicates that they want their character to attempt a `Maneuver` as their action:
1. GM assigns any applicable modifiers to the maneuver.
2. The character decides whether or not to perform the maneuver.
3. If he decides to perform the maneuver, an `open-ended roll` is made, adding appropriate bonus along with any other applicable modifications.
4. A result is obtained by applying the modified roll to the appropriate chart.

#### Static Maneuvers
Any complex or unusual activity not involving significant physical movement (tracking, picking locks, disarming traps, security bypassing, hiding, astrogation, repairs, equipment operation, perception, influencing other characters, etc.).

**Repair**, **Construction** and **Research** tasks are an unusual variety of `Maneuver` — the character can never quite be certain how long they take until he is at least partially finished.

`Orientation Maneuver`: If a character takes a confusing action (e.g., teleports, dives, falls, is knocked down, etc.) or is surprised, the GM may need to determine the awareness and readiness of the character. In this case, the GM may require an orientation roll -20.

Resolved on the `Personal Maneuver Chart`.

#### Vehicular Maneuvers
All driving, steering or other maneuvering control of any vehicle (bicycle, car, spacecraft, or any type of air and water craft, etc.).

Resolved on the `Vehicular Maneuver/Astrogation Chart`.

#### Attacks
Any attempts to affect or harm an opponent with or without a weapon.

Resolved on an appropriate attack table.

## Tactical Activity Tracking System
During combat or other tactical situations that necessitates tracking of environment, player and NPC actions are tracked in intervals of seconds (second-by-second).
A player states an action for his character, spend the necessary time to complete the action, and may then declare another action. 

The `Action/Time Table` is a list of common actions that most characters attempt during tactical situations:

Action | Seconds | |
--- | --- | ---
Movement (walk, run, etc.) | 1+ | 1 pace change allowed pr. sec.
Standing Up From Seated Position | 1 
Kneel/crouch to standing | 2 
Prone to kneel | 2
Prone to standing | 4 (2 + 2)
Rapid Drop To Ground | 1
Careful Drop To Ground | 2
Dive for cover | 1 | x5 pace, Medium MM. End up prone, unless the GM allows for another roll for acrobatics.
Acrobatics / Tumble / etc. | 2 | Pr. 3m
Picking Up Something Off Of The Ground | 3
Mount/Dismount | 5
_ |
Draw weapon | 2
Sheath weapon | 3
Pick up weapon | 4
Change weapon | 5 (3+2)
Ammo Clip reload | 5
_ |
Melee (Attack / Parry) | 8
Thrown | 6
Fire firearm | 4
Missile | 6
Dodge | 1+ | Extremely Hard MM. Ag + Qu bonuses or Acrobatics skill. Any numeric results are applied to the character’s DB.
Disengage From Melee | 3 | Last 2 seconds are movement. May move 3m.
_ |
Orientation Maneuver | 0-1 | Result is a delay before any deliberate action. Failure = 5 sec., Partial success = 4 sec., Near success = 2 sec, Success = 0 sec.
Observation Maneuver | 7 | Perception roll, -10 pr. sec. less
_ |
Misc. Static Action | 10+
Power supply reload | 8-10
Apply first aid | 10 | per hit/round

`Melee`: combatant is engaged in melee if:
- A foe attacked in the previous second, and
- That foe is still within striking distance (i.e., usually within 3m), and
- That foe’s action for the current second is to melee the combatant.

#### Simultaneous actions
Combatants can have multiple simultaneously occurring actions (even movement), if logical.
e. Successful Quick Draw, Dropping An Object, & Instantaneous Spells are 0 second actions.
If actions are closely timed, a GM might allow the slower to still resolve (death blow, etc.)

#### Movement
Walking Moving Rate: 17 x [1 + (St mod + Qu mod)/100] pr. rnd / 10
`Moving Rate`: Walking Moving Rate x Pace multiplier / sec.

Pace multiplier | Description | MM Difficulty (Unencumbered, no pressure) | Modifier to simultaneous actions
--- | --- | --- | ---
x½ | Walking slow | - | 0
x1 | Walking (base) | - | -10 (Hard)
x1½ | Jogging | - | -20 (Very Hard)
x2 | Running | - | -30 (Extremely Hard)
x3 | Running fast | Easy | -40
x4 | Dashing | Light | -50 (Sheer Folly)
x5 | Sprinting | Medium | -60

MM task results apply as normal. The result is the percentage of the distance they would normally move given their rate of speed.
Pace can increase or decrease by 1 multiple once per second, unless GM rules otherwise appropriate.
