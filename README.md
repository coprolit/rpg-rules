# Dice rolling conventions

---

`Open-ended roll` - **1d100** roll that can yield a result lower than 01 or higher than 100.
- A roll under **06** calls for a second roll to be made and subtracted from the first.
- A roll over **95** calls for a second roll to be made and added to the first.

`Modifier` - **bonus** or **penalty** which is applied to the dice roll (e.g. -10 or +25) due to skill bonuses, stat bonuses, difficulty levels, and miscellaneous modifiers applied to the situation.

| Difficulty level | Modifier
| --- | --- |
Routine | +30
Easy | +20
Light | +10
Medium | 0
Hard | -10
Very Hard | -20
Extremely Hard | -30
Sheer Folly | -50
Absurd NA | -70

`Maneuver roll` - modified `Open-ended roll`. To resolve the roll, the result is applied to an appropriate chart.

# Character Activity Rules

---

The type of action a character can perform during play are most commonly classified as either a `simple action` or a `Maneuver` (complex action).

`simple actions` are normal movement and routine activities such as breathing, eating, walking, climbing stairs, drawing a weapon, operating an information terminal, using a screwdriver, etc. and **do not require any rolls to resolve** (the player simply states what he intends his character to do).

## Maneuvers
`Maneuvers` are actions which under normal circumstances have a chance of failing and usually entail an element of risk.
Unusual activities (e.g., swimming, climbing a rope, running up or down stairs, piloting a spacecraft, opening a locked safe, etc.) and activities performed under stress (e.g., running, dodging, stalking, hiding, hacking a security system, engaging in combat etc.) are maneuvers and require rolls. The GM is the final judge as to what is a `maneuver` and requires a `maneuver roll`, and what is normal activity and doesn’t require a roll.

When a player indicates that they want their character to attempt a `Maneuver` as their action:
1. GM assigns any applicable modifiers to the maneuver.
2. The character decides whether or not to perform the maneuver.
3. If he decides to perform the maneuver, an `open-ended roll` is made, adding appropriate bonus along with any other applicable modifications.
4. A result is obtained by applying the modified roll to the appropriate chart.

`Maneuvers` are subdivided into various maneuver types, each with their own charts for resolving the `maneuver roll`:

#### Moving Maneuvers
Any complex or unusual movement, or physical activities performed under stress (running up or down stairs, climbing, swimming, riding, stalking, balancing a ledge, acrobatics, dodging, tumbling, diving, etc.).

- [`Modifiers`](https://skippern.github.io/iRoleMaster.help/Contents/Resources/shared/T/RMSR_T-4.2.png)

#### Attacks
Any attempts to affect or harm an opponent with or without a weapon. Attacks are a special kind of maneuver where the result of a maneuver roll will usually require a second roll on the `Fumble and Failure Tables` or a specific critical table.
- Resolved on an appropriate attack table (specific for weapon type).

#### Equipment Operation Maneuvers
Any unusual use of equipment, equipment use under stress, or usage of unfamiliar technology.
Operating simple, standard equipment (e.g., a telephone, an information terminal, etc.) should be a routine maneuver with an additional +50 modification.

`Orientation roll` If a character takes a confusing action (e.g., teleports, dives, falls, is knocked down, etc.) or is surprised, the GM may need to determine the awareness and readiness of the character. In this case, the GM may require an `orientation roll` -20.

#### Pick locks/Disarm traps/Bypass Maneuvers
Any kind of mechanical, electronic or software override.

## Tactical Activity Tracking System
In a tactical situation, action is resolved in terms of meters and seconds (second-by-second).
A player states an action for his character, spends the necessary time to complete the action, and may then declare another action. 

The `Action/Time Table` is a list of common actions that most characters attempt during tactical situations:

Action | Seconds | |
--- | --- | ---
Movement (walk, run, etc.) | 1+ | 1 pace change allowed pr. sec.
Standing Up From Seated Position | 1 
Kneel/crouch to standing | 2 
Prone to kneel | 2
Prone to standing | 4 (2 + 2)
Rapid Drop To Ground | 1
Careful Drop To Ground | 2
Dive for cover | 1 | x5 pace, Medium MM. End up prone, unless the GM allows for another roll for acrobatics.
Acrobatics / Tumble / etc. | 2 | Pr. 3m
Picking Up Something Off Of The Ground | 3
Mount/Dismount | 5
_ |
Draw weapon | 2
Sheath weapon | 3
Pick up weapon | 4
Change weapon | 5 (3+2)
Ammo Clip reload | 5
_ |
Melee (Attack / Parry) | 8
Thrown | 6
Fire firearm | 4
Missile | 6
Dodge | 1+ | Extremely Hard MM. Ag + Qu bonuses or Acrobatics skill. Any numeric results are applied to the character’s DB.
Disengage From Melee | 3 | Last 2 seconds are movement. May move 3m.
_ |
Orientation Maneuver | 0-1 | Result is a delay before any deliberate action. Failure = 5 sec., Partial success = 4 sec., Near success = 2 sec, Success = 0 sec.
Observation Maneuver | 7 | Perception roll, -10 pr. sec. less
_ |
Misc. Static Action | 10+
Power supply reload | 8-10
Apply first aid | 10 | per hit/round

Rolemaster/Spacemaster `round` = 10 sekunder (10% rnd activity = 1 sekund)

#### Melee
Combatant is engaged in `melee` if:
- A foe attacked in the previous second, and
- That foe is still within striking distance (i.e., usually within 3m), and
- That foe’s action for the current second is to melee the combatant.

#### Moving Rate and Pace
Walking Moving Rate: 17 x [1 + (St mod + Qu mod)/100] pr. rnd / 10
`Moving Rate`: Walking Moving Rate x Pace multiplier / sec.

`Pace` can increase or decrease by 1 multiple once per second, unless GM rules otherwise appropriate.

Pace multiplier | Description | MM Difficulty (Unencumbered, no pressure) | Modifier to simultaneous actions
--- | --- | --- | ---
x½ | Walking slow | - | 0
x1 | Walking (base) | - | -10 (Hard)
x1½ | Jogging | - | -20 (Very Hard)
x2 | Running | - | -30 (Extremely Hard)
x3 | Running fast | Easy | -40
x4 | Dashing | Light | -50 (Sheer Folly)
x5 | Sprinting | Medium | -60

MM task results apply as normal. The result is the percentage of the distance they would normally move given their rate of speed.

#### Canceling action
An action may be canceled before it is resolved. Depending on how stressful the cancelled action was, this may require an `Orientation Maneuver`.

#### Simultaneous actions
Combatants can have multiple simultaneously occurring actions (even movement), if logical (eg. walking while shooting, Successful Quick Draw, Dropping An Object, & Instantaneous Spells are 0 second actions).
If actions are closely timed, a GM might allow the slower to still resolve (death blow, etc.)

#### Charge action
Charge requires running (x2) or greater movement pace.
Charges are the exception to "resolve times". Resolve a charge at the "moment" the combatants meet!
Recovery from the charge is 1/2 base attack time, before new action.
Charging is a special `maneuver` that requires a `movement maneuver roll`, but allows movement at double rate, adds +10 to OB, -10 to DB. Movement does penalize the attack roll!!!
Apply -10 per movement interval used.

#### Parry action
Parrying requires that the character be wielding a weapon.
Parry works as per RMSS. It is in effect for the duration of the "attack time" against any one attack that is "resolved" against the target during that time. (Parry has no affect on time)

#### Dodge action
When a character does not have a weapon (or cannot use their weapon) and want to avoid combat, a character can attempt to Dodge an attack.
This is a dedicated attempt to avoid being hit by getting out of the way of the incoming attack.

**Extremely Hard** `movement maneuver`. Add the average of the character’s Agility and Quickness bonuses, or the character’s Acrobatics skill. Any numeric results are applied to the character’s DB.

If the result falls on the low end of the column, then the character has fumbled their attempt to Dodge and the results are applied. If the result falls on the high end of the table, then the character receives the highest numeric result on that chart column to their DB and the prose result is also applied accordingly.

#### Stunned effect
While stunned (from crits), a combatant may:
- not attack
- may only parry with half of his Offensive Bonus.
- The only other allowable actions are movement and maneuvers (modified by at least -50).

In addition to normal modifications, stunned maneuvers are also modified by three times the character’s SD stat bonus.

#### Surprised/confused effect
Occurs when a player fails to perceive an ambush, hidden foe, etc. (failed Perception roll).
or after confusing action, requiring a orientation roll.
Player may not attempt an action for a number of seconds:
amount by which Perception roll failed / 20
