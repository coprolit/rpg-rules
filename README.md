### Some Dice rolling conventions
`Open-ended roll`: **1d100** roll that can yield a result lower than 01 or higher than 100.
A roll under **06** calls for a second roll to be made and subtracted from the first.
A roll over **95** calls for a second roll to be made and added to the first.

`Modifier`: **bonus** or **penalty** which is applied to the dice roll, _e.g. skill bonuses,
stat bonuses, difficulty levels, and miscellaneous modifiers applied to the situation_.

`Maneuver roll`: modified `Open-ended roll`. To resolve the roll, the result is applied to an appropriate chart.

# Character Activity Rules
The type of action a character can perform during play are most commonly classified as either a `simple action` or a `Maneuver` (complex action).

`simple actions` are normal movement and routine activities such as breathing, eating, walking, climbing stairs, drawing a weapon, etc. and **do not require any rolls to resolve** (the player simply states what he intends his character to do).

## Maneuvers
**`Maneuvers`** are actions which under normal circumstances have a chance of failing and usually entail an element of risk.
Unusual activities (e.g., swimming, climbing a rope, running up or down stairs, piloting a spacecraft, opening a locked safe, etc.) and activities performed under stress (e.g., running, dodging, stalking, hiding, hacking a security system, engaging in combat etc.) are maneuvers and require rolls. The GM is the final judge as to what is a `maneuver` and requires a `maneuver roll`, and what is normal activity and doesn’t require a roll.

When a player indicates that they want their character to attempt a `Maneuver` as their action:
1. GM assigns any applicable modifiers to the maneuver.
2. The character decides whether or not to perform the maneuver.
3. If he decides to perform the maneuver, an `open-ended roll` is made, adding appropriate bonus along with any other applicable modifications.
4. A result is obtained by applying the modified roll to the appropriate chart.

`Maneuvers` are subdivided into various maneuver types, each with their own charts for resolving the `maneuver roll`:

**`Moving Maneuvers`**
Any complex or unusual movement, or physical activities performed under stress (running up or down stairs, climbing, swimming, riding, stalking, balancing a ledge, acrobatics, dodging, tumbling, diving, etc.).

- [`Modifiers`](https://skippern.github.io/iRoleMaster.help/Contents/Resources/shared/T/RMSR_T-4.2.png)

**`Attacks`**
Any attempts to affect or harm an opponent with or without a weapon. Attacks are a special kind of maneuver where the result of a maneuver roll will usually require a second roll on the `Fumble and Failure Tables` or a specific critical table.

Resolved on an appropriate attack table (specific for weapon type) .

**`Equipment Operation Maneuvers`**
When using any sort of equipment, the Player should roll 1D100. A result of 01-02 indicates some sort of instrument failure.
If this happens, roll 1D10 to determine what went wrong:
1-7 — item is out of power
8-9 — item malfunction (roll again for severity and then roll on the [`Equipment Mishandling Chart`](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1jiaOSBMgAktKZqkKTJJfIBFj4GVhMvFj))
10 — Item has been dropped (roll again for severity and then roll on the [`Equipment Mishandling Chart`](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1jiaOSBMgAktKZqkKTJJfIBFj4GVhMvFj) with a -10 modification)

To determine the severity of a breakage, roll 1D10:
1-5 — Routine (+20 on [`Equipment Mishandling Chart`](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1jiaOSBMgAktKZqkKTJJfIBFj4GVhMvFj))
6 — Light (+10 on [`Equipment Mishandling Chart`](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1jiaOSBMgAktKZqkKTJJfIBFj4GVhMvFj))
7 — Moderate (+0 on [`Equipment Mishandling Chart`](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1jiaOSBMgAktKZqkKTJJfIBFj4GVhMvFj))
8 — Severe (-10 on [`Equipment Mishandling Chart`](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1jiaOSBMgAktKZqkKTJJfIBFj4GVhMvFj))
9 — Very Severe (-20 on [`Equipment Mishandling Chart`](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1jiaOSBMgAktKZqkKTJJfIBFj4GVhMvFj))
10 — Extremely Severe (-30 on [`Equipment Mishandling Chart`](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1jiaOSBMgAktKZqkKTJJfIBFj4GVhMvFj))

In addition, if the character falls or is hit in a body location which stores an item, there is a 50% chance that the item will suffer instrument failure. If a result is rolled that is impossible, no failure occurs
(e.g., a phone mounted on a wall can not be dropped, a terminal plugged into the wall will not be “out of power” unless the local power net goes down).



**`Construction/Research Maneuver`**
Construction and Research tasks are an unusual variety of `Maneuver` — the character can never quite be certain how long they take until he is at least partially finished.
[Construction/Research Modifications Chart](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1gz80stxpaNaAkewMxoWQ3wU38HOimD84)

**`Repair Maneuver`**
An unusual variety of Maneuver - the character can never quite be certain how long it takes until he is at least partially finished. Modified by the appropriate Technical skill bonus.
The result indicates how long the repair maneuver took to complete, and may indicate a “CIP” — Cost In Parts. This is a percentage of the base cost of the original unit.
- [`Malfunction / Repair Chart`](https://drive.google.com/open?id=18Vo4yWrWMYUSPOjC4sZEUapUlSwAleNp).

The chart assumes a team (of at least two people) are working on the repair.
One character involved: double the time amounts shown on the chart.
More than two skilled people involved: add +5 to the roll for each additional skilled helper.

**`Perception Maneuver`**
Perception, orientation, data-gathering.

`Orientation roll` If a character takes a confusing action (e.g., teleports, dives, falls, is knocked down, etc.) or is surprised, the GM may need to determine the awareness and readiness of the character. In this case, the GM may require an `orientation roll` -20.

**`Static Maneuvers`**
Any other (not covered above) complex or unusual activity not involving significant movement.

#### Vehicular Maneuvers
All driving, steering or other maneuvering control of any vehicle (bicycle, car, spacecraft, or any type of air and water craft, etc.).

Resolved on the `Vehicular Maneuver/Astrogation Chart`.

## Tactical Activity Tracking System
In a tactical situation, action is resolved in terms of meters and seconds.
A player states an action for his character, spends the necessary time to complete the action, and may then declare another action. 

The `Action/Time Table` is a list of common actions that most characters attempt during tactical situations:

Action | Seconds | |
--- | --- | ---
Movement (walk, run, etc.) | 1+ | 1 pace change allowed pr. sec.
Standing Up From Seated Position | 1 
Kneel/crouch to standing | 2 
Prone to kneel | 2
Prone to standing | 4 (2 + 2)
Rapid Drop To Ground | 1
Careful Drop To Ground | 2
Dive for cover | 1 | x5 pace, Medium MM. End up prone, unless the GM allows for another roll for acrobatics.
Acrobatics / Tumble / etc. | 2 | Pr. 3m
Picking Up Something Off Of The Ground | 3
Mount/Dismount | 5
_ |
Draw weapon | 2
Sheath weapon | 3
Pick up weapon | 4
Change weapon | 5 (3+2)
Ammo Clip reload | 5
_ |
Melee (Attack / Parry) | 8
Thrown | 6
Fire firearm | 4
Missile | 6
Dodge | 1+ | Extremely Hard MM. Ag + Qu bonuses or Acrobatics skill. Any numeric results are applied to the character’s DB.
Disengage From Melee | 3 | Last 2 seconds are movement. May move 3m.
_ |
Orientation Maneuver | 0-1 | Result is a delay before any deliberate action. Failure = 5 sec., Partial success = 4 sec., Near success = 2 sec, Success = 0 sec.
Observation Maneuver | 7 | Perception roll, -10 pr. sec. less
_ |
Misc. Static Action | 10+
Power supply reload | 8-10
Apply first aid | 10 | per hit/round

`Melee` - combatant is engaged in melee if:
- A foe attacked in the previous second, and
- That foe is still within striking distance (i.e., usually within 3m), and
- That foe’s action for the current second is to melee the combatant.

`Canceling Action` - An action may be canceled before it is resolved. Depending on how stressful the cancelled action was, this may require an `Orientation Maneuver`.

#### Simultaneous actions
Combatants can have multiple simultaneously occurring actions (even movement), if logical.
e. Successful Quick Draw, Dropping An Object, & Instantaneous Spells are 0 second actions.
If actions are closely timed, a GM might allow the slower to still resolve (death blow, etc.)

#### Movement
Walking Moving Rate: 17 x [1 + (St mod + Qu mod)/100] pr. rnd / 10
`Moving Rate`: Walking Moving Rate x Pace multiplier / sec.

Pace multiplier | Description | MM Difficulty (Unencumbered, no pressure) | Modifier to simultaneous actions
--- | --- | --- | ---
x½ | Walking slow | - | 0
x1 | Walking (base) | - | -10 (Hard)
x1½ | Jogging | - | -20 (Very Hard)
x2 | Running | - | -30 (Extremely Hard)
x3 | Running fast | Easy | -40
x4 | Dashing | Light | -50 (Sheer Folly)
x5 | Sprinting | Medium | -60

MM task results apply as normal. The result is the percentage of the distance they would normally move given their rate of speed.
Pace can increase or decrease by 1 multiple once per second, unless GM rules otherwise appropriate.
