# Character Activity Rules

The type of action a character can perform during play are most commonly classified as either a `simple action` or a `Maneuver` (complex action).

`simple actions` are normal movement and routine activities such as breathing, eating, walking, climbing stairs, drawing a weapon, operating an information terminal, using a screwdriver, etc. and **do not require any rolls to resolve** (the player simply states what he intends his character to do).

## Maneuvers
`Maneuvers` are actions which under normal circumstances have a chance of failing and usually entail an element of risk.
Unusual activities (e.g., swimming, climbing a rope, running up or down stairs, piloting a spacecraft, opening a locked safe, etc.) and activities performed under stress (e.g., running, dodging, stalking, hiding, hacking a security system, engaging in combat etc.) are maneuvers and require rolls. The GM is the final judge as to what is a `maneuver` and requires a `maneuver roll`, and what is normal activity and doesn’t require a roll.

When a player indicates that they want their character to attempt a `Maneuver` as their action:
1. GM assigns any applicable modifiers to the maneuver.
2. The character decides whether or not to perform the maneuver.
3. If he decides to perform the maneuver, an `open-ended roll` is made, adding appropriate bonus along with any other applicable modifications.
4. A result is obtained by applying the modified roll to the appropriate chart.

`Maneuvers` are subdivided into various maneuver types, each with their own charts for resolving the `maneuver roll`:

#### Moving Maneuvers
Any complex or unusual movement, or physical activities performed under stress (running up or down stairs, climbing, swimming, riding, stalking, balancing a ledge, acrobatics, dodging, tumbling, diving, etc.).

#### Attacks
Any attempts to affect or harm an opponent with or without a weapon. 
Successful attacks beat down the target’s body and will to fight (`hits`) and may also cause specific acute injuries (`criticals`). Defenders can avoid injuries through dodging, parrying, or armor.

Attacks are a special kind of maneuver where the maneuver roll is resolved on an appropriate attack table (specific for weapon type), often requiring a second roll on the `Fumble and Failure Tables` or a specific critical table.

#### Equipment Operation Maneuvers
Any unusual use of equipment, equipment use under stress, or usage of unfamiliar technology.
Operating simple, standard equipment (e.g., a telephone, an information terminal, etc.) should be a routine maneuver with an additional +50 modification.

`Orientation roll` If a character takes a confusing action (e.g., teleports, dives, falls, is knocked down, etc.) or is surprised, the GM may need to determine the awareness and readiness of the character. In this case, the GM may require an `orientation roll` -20.

#### Pick locks/Disarm traps/Bypass Maneuvers
Any kind of mechanical, electronic or software override.
