# Dice rolling conventions

`Open-ended roll` - a **1d100** roll that can yield a result lower than 01 or higher than 100.
- A roll under **06** calls for a second roll to be made and subtracted from the first.
- A roll over **95** calls for a second roll to be made and added to the first.

`Modifier` - a **bonus** or **penalty** which is applied to the dice roll (e.g. -10 or +25) due to skill bonuses, stat bonuses, difficulty levels, and miscellaneous modifiers applied to the situation.

| Difficulty level | Modifier
| --- | --- |
Routine | +30
Easy | +20
Light | +10
Medium | 0
Hard | -10
Very Hard | -20
Extremely Hard | -30
Sheer Folly | -50
Absurd NA | -70

`Maneuver roll` - a modified `Open-ended roll`. To resolve the roll, the result is applied to an appropriate chart.
