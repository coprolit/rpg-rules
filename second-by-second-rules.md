## Tactical Activity Tracking
In a tactical situation, action is tracked in terms of meters and seconds (second-by-second).
A player states an action for his character, spends the necessary time to complete the action, and may then declare another action. 

The `Action/Time Table` is a list of common actions and default time cost that most characters attempt during tactical situations:

Action | Seconds | |
--- | --- | ---
Movement (walk, run, etc.) | 1+ | 1 pace change allowed pr. sec.
Standing Up From Seated Position | 1 
Kneel/crouch to standing | 2 
Prone to kneel | 2
Prone to standing | 4 (2 + 2)
Rapid Drop To Ground | 1
Careful Drop To Ground | 2
Dive for cover | 1 | x5 pace, Medium MM. End up prone, unless the GM allows for another roll for acrobatics.
Acrobatics / Tumble / etc. | 2 | Pr. 3m
Picking Up Something Off Of The Ground | 3
Mount/Dismount | 5
Rapid dismount | 2
_ |
Draw weapon | 2
Sheath weapon | 3
Pick up weapon | 4
Change weapon | 5 (3+2)
Ammo Clip reload | 5
_ |
Melee (Attack / Parry) | 8
Thrown | 6
Fire firearm | 4
Missile | 6
Dodge | 1+ | Extremely Hard MM. Ag + Qu bonuses or Acrobatics skill. Any numeric results are applied to the character’s DB.
Disengage From Melee | 3 | Last 2 seconds are movement. May move 3m.
_ |
Orientation Maneuver | 0-1 | Result is a delay before any deliberate action. Failure = 5 sec., Partial success = 4 sec., Near success = 2 sec, Success = 0 sec.
Observation Maneuver | 7 | Perception roll, -10 pr. sec. less
_ |
Misc. Static Action | 10+
Power supply reload | 8-10
Apply first aid | 10 | per hit/round

Rolemaster/Spacemaster `round` = 10 sekunder (10% rnd activity = 1 sekund)

#### Reducing the time required for an action
`Manuevers` can be sped up, adding a penalty to the `Maneuver roll`, one difficulty modifier level pr. second less. The action’s duration can be reduced to **no less/more than half of the default duration** and to **no less than 1 second**.
If a character wishes to accomplish a `simple action` in a faster time than normal, there is an increased element of risk and the GM may consequently require a `Maneuver Roll`, using the relevant skill and attribute.

Rolls are always resolved at the end of the duration of an action.

#### Melee
Combatant is engaged in `melee` if:
- A foe attacked in the previous second, and
- That foe is still within striking distance (i.e., usually within 3m), and
- That foe’s action for the current second is to melee the combatant.

#### Canceling action
An action may be canceled before it is resolved. Depending on how stressful the cancelled action was, this may require an `Orientation Maneuver`.

#### Opportunity action
An action that is put on hold, turning it into an out-of-turn action taken in response to a trigger. An opportunity action interrupts the action that triggered it. It completes prior to the interrupted action, and if the interrupted action becomes impossible to complete, it is lost.

#### Conflicting actions

#### Simultaneous actions
Combatants can have multiple simultaneously occurring actions (even movement), if logical (eg. walking while shooting, Successful Quick Draw, Dropping An Object, & Instantaneous Spells are 0 second actions).

#### Charge action
If an attacker is moving at running pace or higher into a foe for an attack, the attack is considered a charge.
- Charge requires running (x2) or greater movement pace.
- Charges are the exception to "resolve times". Resolve a charge at the "moment" the combatants meet!
- Recovery from the charge is 1/2 base attack time, before new action.
- Charging is a special `maneuver` that requires a `movement maneuver roll`, adds +10 to OB, -10 to DB. 
- Movement does penalize the attack roll.

#### Parry action
Parrying requires that the character be wielding a weapon.
Parry works as per RMSS. It is in effect for the duration of the "attack time" against any one attack that is "resolved" against the target during that time. (Parry has no affect on time)

#### Dodge action
When a character does not have a weapon (or cannot use their weapon) and want to avoid combat, a character can attempt to Dodge an attack.
This is a dedicated attempt to avoid being hit by getting out of the way of the incoming attack.

**Extremely Hard** `movement maneuver`. Add the average of the character’s Agility and Quickness bonuses, or the character’s Acrobatics skill. Any numeric results are applied to the character’s DB.

If the result falls on the low end of the column, then the character has fumbled their attempt to Dodge and the results are applied. If the result falls on the high end of the table, then the character receives the highest numeric result on that chart column to their DB and the prose result is also applied accordingly.

#### Stunned effect
While stunned (from crits), a combatant may:
- not attack
- may only parry with half of his Offensive Bonus.
- The only other allowable actions are movement and maneuvers (modified by at least -50).

In addition to normal modifications, stunned maneuvers are also modified by three times the character’s SD stat bonus.

#### Surprised/confused effect
Occurs when a player fails to perceive an ambush, hidden foe, etc. (failed Perception roll).
or after confusing action, requiring a orientation roll.
Player may not attempt an action for a number of seconds:
amount by which Perception roll failed / 20
