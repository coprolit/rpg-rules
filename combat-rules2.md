# Combat Rules

## Parry
The amount of parry to be used and who it will be used against must be announced at the beginning of the round, or as soon as melee ensues. At the beginning of the round, a player should know what his Defensive Bonus is against each of his opponents.

## Effects from criticals.

| State | MM Penalty | Duration | Other |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
Staggered (or Knocked Prone) | -25* | max one round | unable to attack
Knocked Back | -25* | max one round | unable to attack
Dazed | -25* | cumulative |
Stunned | -50* | cumulative | unable to attack, can parry with half of OB
Stunned and unable to parry | -50* | cumulative | unable to attack and parry

_* MM are modified by +3x SD bonus_

_"You have initiative"_ =  Foe gets -1d10 to next initiative roll.
_"next round"_ = next turn (this round or the next).
_"for ß rounds"_ = beginning from target’s next turn (this round or the next).

### Staggered or Prone
Becoming staggered means that the combatant has been knocked off balance. A staggered result incurs a penalty of -25, and the combatant cannot attack, however the effect only lasts one round, no matter how many staggered results are received.

If a combatant is knocked prone, he is also automatically staggered. Prone means the target has been thrown flat to the floor and is subject to the usual modifiers to action for prone position, and he must take a 1 Action Point action to stand up again.

### Knocked Back
Being knocked back will move the character in a given direction for a distance in feet indicated by the critical result. The character will arrive at that point staggered per above and, depending on terrain, may suffer additional effects.

### Stun
A stun means the combatant has been knocked hard enough to disorient and put him in a vulnerable state.
There are three different types of stun; a defender under the effect of any form of stun cannot initiate useful attacks.

__Dazed__ : A minor disorientation where the combatant is dizzy and unstable. He is at -25 to all maneuvers.

__Stunned__: The combatant has been hit seriously enough to disrupt his senses, and he is struggling to control his body.
He may not attack, and only parry with half his OB. He is at -50 to all maneuvers.

__Stunned and unable to parry__: Suffering from a serious blow, the combatant is having a hard time remaining standing and nearly at his foe’s mercy.
As stunned, but also unable to parry.

All stun results are cumulative (stacks).
One round of stun effect wears off at the end of the round of effect, from the worst effect to the least (stunned and unable to parry before stunned, which wears off before dazed).
