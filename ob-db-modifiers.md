Only one type of cover may be used at a given time.

- `Half cover` covers approximately 50% of a characterâ€™s body,
- `Full cover` covers 80% or more of the characters body.
- `Soft cover` is defined as something that hinders an attack, but not well enough to fully absorb the blow (such as a bush or a
sheet hanging on a line to dry).
- `Hard cover` is defined as being so sturdy that most damaging effects cannot get through it immediately (such as a low wall, over-turned table, or full walls).
