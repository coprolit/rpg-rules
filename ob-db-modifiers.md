`DB` A combatant’s Defensive Bonus is modified by three times his Quickness stat bonus or penalty. If the defender is wearing certain types of cumbersome armor, this tripled Quickness stat bonus may be reduced or eliminated completely by the armor’s Armor Quickness Penalty (but never below zero);

_A defender only has three times his Quickness stat bonus factored into his DB if he is aware that he is in a combat situation and is free to move._

### Cover

| COVER | DB Bonus |
| --- | --- |
Half Soft Cover | +20
Full Soft Cover | +40
Half Hard Cover | +50
Full Hard Cover | +100
Half Reinforced Cover | +50
Full Reinforced Cover | +100

Only one type of cover may be used at a given time.

- `Half cover` covers approximately 50% of a character’s body,
- `Full cover` covers 80% or more of the characters body.
- `Soft cover` is defined as something that hinders an attack, but not well enough to fully absorb the blow (such as a bush or a
sheet hanging on a line to dry).
- `Hard cover` is defined as being so sturdy that most damaging effects cannot get through it immediately (such as a low wall, over-turned table, or full walls). 

Prolonged or concentrated burst fire from advanced weapons can degrade `Hard Cover` into `Soft Cover`.

- `Reinforced cover` is defined as being specifically hardened against attacks (such as blast doors, closed habitat domes, or starship hulls). While it is not impenetrable, even advanced personal weaponry will take a long time to reduce its efficacy.
