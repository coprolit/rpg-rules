# Combat Rules

## Attack Procedure
1. Roll `open-ended` high.
2. If the initial die roll falls within the fumble range for the weapon/attack, resolve the fumble. The attack procedure ends here. Otherwise, continue:
3. Add your character's OB to the final die result .
4. Subtract your foe's DB from the adjust die total.
5. Look up the modified result on the weapon attack table.

There will be three possible results, a miss (denoted by a "-" in the table), a normal hit (denoted by a number; e.g., 8), or a critical hit (denoted by a number and a letter; e.g., 10D).

## Combat Actions
### Parry action
Parrying requires that the character be wielding a weapon. Parry works as per RMSS. It is in effect for the duration of the "attack time" against any one attack that is "resolved" against the target during that time. (Parry has no affect on time)

### Dodge action
When a character does not have a weapon (or cannot use their weapon) and want to avoid combat, a character can attempt to Dodge an attack. This is a dedicated attempt to avoid being hit by getting out of the way of the incoming attack.

Extremely Hard `movement maneuver`. Add the average of the character’s Agility and Quickness bonuses, or the character’s Acrobatics skill. Any numeric results are applied to the character’s DB.

If the result falls on the low end of the column, then the character has fumbled their attempt to Dodge and the results are applied. If the result falls on the high end of the table, then the character receives the highest numeric result on that chart column to their DB and the prose result is also applied accordingly.

## Melee
Combatant is engaged in melee if:

- A foe attacked in the previous second, and
- That foe is still within striking distance (i.e., usually within 3m), and
- That foe’s action for the current `round` is to melee the combatant.

## Effects from Criticals

__"You have initiative"__ =  Foe gets -1d10 to next initiative roll.

__"next round"__ = next turn (this round or the next).

__"for ß rounds"__ = beginning from target’s next turn (this round or the next).

| State | Maneuver Penalty | Duration | Other |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
Staggered (or Knocked Prone) | -25* | max one round | unable to attack
Knocked Back | -25* | max one round | unable to attack
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
Dazed | -25* | cumulative | unable to attack
Stunned | -50* | cumulative | unable to attack, can parry with half of OB
Stunned and unable to parry | -50* | cumulative | unable to attack and parry

_* modified by +3x SD bonus_

### Staggered or Prone
Becoming staggered means that the combatant has been knocked off balance. A staggered result incurs a penalty of -25, and the combatant cannot attack, however the effect only lasts one round, no matter how many staggered results are received.

If a combatant is knocked prone, he is also automatically staggered. Prone means the target has been thrown flat to the floor and is subject to the usual modifiers to action for prone position, and he must take a 1 `Action Point` action to stand up again.

### Knocked Back
Being knocked back will move the character in a given direction for a distance in feet indicated by the critical result. The character will arrive at that point staggered per above and, depending on terrain, may suffer additional effects.

### Stunned
A stun means the combatant has been knocked hard enough to disorient and put him in a vulnerable state.
There are three different types of stun; a defender under the effect of any form of stun cannot initiate useful attacks.

__Dazed__ : A minor disorientation where the combatant is dizzy and unstable. He is at -25 to all maneuvers.

__Stunned__: The combatant has been hit seriously enough to disrupt his senses, and he is struggling to control his body.
He may not attack, and only parry with half his OB. He is at -50 to all maneuvers.

__Stunned and unable to parry__: Suffering from a serious blow, the combatant is having a hard time remaining standing and nearly at his foe’s mercy.
As stunned, but also unable to parry.

All stun results are cumulative (stacks).
One round of stun effect wears off at the end of the round of effect, from the worst effect to the least (stunned and unable to parry before stunned, which wears off before dazed).

## Surprised / Confused Effect
Occurs when a player fails to perceive an ambush, hidden foe, etc. requiring a `Perception roll`, or after confusing action, requiring a `orientation roll`.

__Failure__ = can perform no further actions in round.

__Partial success__ = Stunned 1 round

__Near success__ = Dazed 1 round

__Success__ = No effect
