# Movement Maneuvers
**Encumbrance MM penalty** = -20 x load / load allowance

For normal movement, a `maneuver roll` is not required; however, for stressful situations such as moving in rough terrain or while stunned, a roll is required (using the appropriate skill of Running, Swimming, etc.). For example, a combatant who is running in a zigzag toward an enemy outpost should make a roll; likewise, a `maneuver roll` is called for if a combatant is stunned or moving across slick ground, broken terrain, or other similar obstacles.

MM task results apply as normal. The result is the percentage of the distance they would normally move given their rate of speed.
