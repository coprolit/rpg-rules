# Movement Rules
### Moving Rate and Pace
Walking Moving Rate: 17 x [1 + (St mod + Qu mod)/100] pr. rnd / 10 sec.
`Moving Rate`: Walking Moving Rate x Pace multiplier

A character can change his `pace` multiple up or down by 1 multiple each second he is moving.

Pace multiplier | Description | Modifier to simultaneous actions
--- | --- | ---
x0.25 | Crawling | 0
x½ | Walking slow / creeping | 0
x½ | Climbing | NA
x1 | Walking (base) | -10 (Hard)
x1½ | Jogging | -20 (Very Hard)
x2 | Running | -30 (Extremely Hard)
x3 | Running fast | -40
x4 | Dashing | -50 (Sheer Folly)
x5 | Sprinting | -60

MM task results apply as normal. The result is the percentage of the distance they would normally move given their rate of speed.
