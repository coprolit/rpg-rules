1) Make open-ended roll adding appropriate skill bonus, range modifer, etc.

2) If result is:
- 100+, the object has landed exactly as intended
- 99 or less, the `Error Chart` indicates how many meters from the target site it actually landed.

GM rolls randomly to determine the direction of error (on a hex-grid map, roll 1d6 and count clockwise).

3) Determine who/what is in the affected area, and which Blast Radius they are in (each Blast Radius extends outward 2m per Mk#).

4) Make attack roll against the 'Grenade/Explosive Attack Table' using the damage threshold of the appropriate Blast Radius.
