# Injury, death, healing rules

### Hits taken
Concussion hits are an abstract way of tracking a character’s pain, degrees of injuries and hold on consciousness.

#### Unconsciousness
A character reduced to 0 or less hits will fall unconscious. Characters at less than full hits will feel bruised, beaten and shaken.

#### Recovery from hits
1 per hour if the character rests (1 per three hours if the character is active).

### Injuries
Injuries (specific damage to a part of the body), apply a penalty that represents the pain and incapacity caused by the injury. They require longer recovery even after being ‘healed’.

#### Degrees of injury
Injuries are assigned a severity depending on the penalty or amount of bleeding:

`light` - cause up to 5 hits per round, or a penalty of up to -20.

`medium` - cause 6 to 10 hits per round, or a penalty of -21 to -50 (this category includes fractures with unspecified penalties)

`severe` - cause more than 10 hits per round, or a penalty of more than -50 (this category includes shattered bones, destroyed organs, etc.).

#### First Aid
`bandage` and `compress` stops up to **3 hits per round** (the hits per round will start again if the character does more than walk during next 8 hours).

`tourniquet` stops up to **10 hits per round** (until the wound is healed the tourniquet must be loosened once every 24 rounds, and 3 hits per round will be taken for 5 rounds).

#### Recovery from injuries
When an injury is treated, a recovery roll is made to determine how long it takes to recover:

Half recovery time if the victim is hospitalied or placed in some other special care.
