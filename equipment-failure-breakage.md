## Equipment failure and breakage rules

When using any sort of equipment, the Player should roll 1D100. A result of 01-02 indicates some sort of instrument failure.
If this happens, roll 1D10 to determine what went wrong:
- 1-7 — item is out of power
- 8-9 — item malfunction (roll again for `severity` and then roll on the [`Equipment Mishandling Chart`](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1jiaOSBMgAktKZqkKTJJfIBFj4GVhMvFj))
- 10 — Item has been dropped (roll again for `severity` and then roll on the [`Equipment Mishandling Chart`](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1jiaOSBMgAktKZqkKTJJfIBFj4GVhMvFj) with a -10 modification)

To determine the `severity` of a breakage, roll 1D10:
- 1-5 — Routine
- 6 — Light
- 7 — Moderate
- 8 — Severe
- 9 — Very Severe
- 10 — Extremely Severe

In addition, if the character falls or is hit in a body location which stores an item, there is a 50% chance that the item will suffer instrument failure. If a result is rolled that is impossible, no failure occurs (e.g., a phone mounted on a wall can not be dropped, a terminal plugged into the wall will not be “out of power” unless the local power net goes down).
