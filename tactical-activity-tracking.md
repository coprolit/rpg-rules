# Tactical Activity Tracking Rules

`Round` - In a tactical situation, action is tracked in **rounds of five seconds**.

`Initiative` - determines the order in which combatants declare and resolve their actions.

`Action` - Actions include any activity the character performs including attacking, reloading, applying first aid, retrieving items from a backpack, etc.

`Action Points`- Actions are assigned a number of **Action Points** (AP) to represent the dedication or concentration required. Combatants receive **4 Action Points every round**, which may be spent among any number of actions.

## Round
Tactical game time is tracked in `rounds` of approximately 5 seconds, with combatants taking turns to perform actions and movement.

A round consists of 4 phases:
- Initiative Phase
- Declaration Phase
- Resolution Phase

### Initiative Phase
Each combatants roll 2d10 + Qu bonus (+/- appropriate combat effects) to determine their initiative.

### Declaration Phase
Combatants declare actions for the round, in order from lowest initiative to highest.

Combatants receive 4 Action Points every round, that may be spent among any number of actions.
All combatants may move up to the maximum of their movement allowance. Normal movement, excluding Moving Maneuvers, has no AP cost.

### Resolution Phase
Combatants take turns and resolve their declared actions, in order from highest to lowest initiative.
End of turn each combatant:
- subtracts hits due to bleeding.
- reduces stun effects 1 round, starting with the most severe effect (Stunned/Unable to Parry, then Stunned, then Dazed).
- removes any staggered effect.

## Actions
Actions include any activity the character performs including shooting, melee, or retrieving items from a backpack, etc.

Actions are assigned a number of Action Points (AP) to represent the ‘dedication’ required:
