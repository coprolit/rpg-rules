# Tactical Activity Tracking Rules

`Round` - In a tactical situation, action is tracked in **rounds of five seconds**.

`Initiative` - determines the order in which combatants declare and resolve their actions.

`Action` - Actions include any activity the character performs including attacking, reloading, applying first aid, retrieving items from a backpack, etc.

`Action Points`- Actions are assigned a number of **Action Points** (AP) to represent the dedication or concentration required. Combatants receive **4 Action Points every round**, which may be spent among any number of actions.

## Round
Tactical game time is tracked in `rounds` of approximately 5 seconds, with combatants taking turns to perform actions and movement.

A round consists of 4 phases:
- Initiative Phase
- Declaration Phase
- Resolution Phase

### Initiative Phase
Each combatants roll 2d10 + Qu bonus (+/- appropriate combat effects) to determine their initiative.

### Declaration Phase
Combatants declare actions for the round, in order from lowest initiative to highest.

Combatants receive 4 Action Points every round, that may be spent among any number of actions.
All combatants may move up to the maximum of their movement allowance. Normal movement, excluding Moving Maneuvers, has no AP cost.

### Resolution Phase
Combatants take turns and resolve their declared actions, in order from highest to lowest initiative.

End of turn each combatant:
- subtracts hits due to bleeding.
- reduces stun effects 1 round, starting with the most severe effect (Stunned/Unable to Parry, then Stunned, then Dazed).
- removes any staggered effect.

## Actions
Actions include any activity the character performs including shooting, melee, or retrieving items from a backpack, etc.

Actions are assigned a number of Action Points (AP) to represent the ‘dedication’ required:

| Action | AP cost | - |
| --- | --- | --- |
Ranged Attack | 1-3* |
Melee Attack/Parry | 2-4* |
Thrown Attack | 2-4* |

Orientation Maneuver | 0 | Failure = can perform no further actions in round, Partial success = Stunned 1 round, Near success = Dazed 1 round, Success = No effect

____________________________________ | _________ |

_* Actions with a range of AP can be performed at a penalty of -25 for each AP less than the normal maximum._

### Cancel action
During Resolution Phase, a player can cancel any declared actions during his turn before it is resolved. (Depending on how stressful the cancelled action was, this may require an Orientation Maneuver ??), giving the penalty of losing his initiative dices the following round.

### Conditional Action
A conditional action is a held action that can be triggered when certain conditions are met later in the round. The action is resolved if and when the trigger condition occurs (interrupting the triggering action).
Conditional actions can be held for as long as the character can maintain unbroken concentration, until end of round. If the conditional action is never triggered, the action is lost.

### Instantaneous actions
Some actions occur so quickly they are treated as instantaneous (0 AP); the first such action costs 0 AP and is thus a “free” action taking no time during the round, however any further instantaneous actions performed that round take 1 AP each. This represents the fact that no action is strictly instantaneous.

### Round to Round Actions
A few actions may require more than 4 AP such as donning or removing armor, or picking a complicated lock. These actions take multiple rounds to complete and must usually be performed uninterrupted by other actions (although they may be combined with other actions such as movement).
