# Tactical Activity Tracking Rules

Intent is to combine the second-by-second (simultaneous) and turn-based (sequential) tracking systems into a sligthly less realistic, but more managable system - that still allow for tactical interactions (reactions).

Tactical game time is tracked in rounds, with combattants taking turns to perform 1 medium action, or 2 minor actions, or ½ of a major action, per round.

1) Roll initiative, Qu bonus + 2d10.
2) Declare actions lowest to highest.
3) Resolve actions conflicts, if any.
4) Perform actions highest to lowest.
5) Perform clean-up.

`Round` = approximately 4 seconds.
(SM/RM's 10 sec. `round` effects need to be converted ad hoc)

### Medium actions
- Firearm fire
- Ammo clip reload
- Movement/acrobatics
- ½ Melee attack (-50)
- change weapon
- throw something

### Minor actions
- Change stance one degree (prone <> kneel/crouch <> standing)
- Drop to prone
- Picking up something
- Draw weapon
- Sheath weapon

### Major actions (spans 2 rounds)
- Full melee attack/parry
- Dodge
- First aid
- Misc. static actions (e.g. replacing power supply)

Major actions can be performed as a medium action with a -50 modifier to roll.

Melee range = 3m
While in melee, max movement is 3m.
