# Tactical Activity Tracking Rules

Intent is to combine the second-by-second (simultaneous) and turn-based (sequential) tracking systems into a sligthly less realistic, but more managable system - that still allow for tactical interactions (reactions).

Tactical game time is tracked in rounds, with combattants taking turns to perform 1 medium action, or 2 minor actions, or ½ of a major action, per round.

1) Roll initiative, Qu bonus + 2d10.
2) Perform actions highest to lowest.
3) Perform clean-up.

**Hold action** - A character can set his turn on 'hold' and take it later after a specified character's turn in the same round.
**Holding Initiative** - Sometimes a character may wish to “hold” his action, choosing to delay taking his turn to wait and see what might happen. On his initiative, a character may declare that he is holding his action and choose to do nothing. At any point before the end of the round he may choose to re-join the initiative and take his action.
**Opportunity action** - A character set his turn on 'hold' and interrupt a specific action (opportunity action is taken just before trigger action) of another character. If the opportunity action is never triggered, the character's turn is lost.


`Round` = approximately 4 seconds.
(SM/RM's 10 sec. `round` effects need to be converted ad hoc)

### Medium actions
- Firearm fire
- Ammo clip reload
- Movement/acrobatics
- ½ Melee attack (-50)
- change weapon
- throw something

### Minor actions
- Change stance one degree (prone <> kneel/crouch <> standing)
- Drop to prone
- Picking up something
- Draw weapon
- Sheath weapon

### Major actions (spans 2 rounds)
- Full melee attack/parry
- Dodge
- First aid
- Misc. static actions (e.g. replacing power supply)

Major actions can be performed as a medium action with a -50 modifier to roll.

Melee range = 3m
While in melee, max movement is 3m.
