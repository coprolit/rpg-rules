# Tactical Activity Tracking Rules

## Tactical round
In a tactical situation, action is tracked in rounds of five seconds. During a `round` combatans perform actions (movement, attack, etc.) by roughly ordering the charactersâ€™ actions based on when they would be completed (short actions complete before longer actions).

Actions are assigned a number of `Action Points` (AP) to represent the time required (see AP table).

Combatants receive **4 Action Points every round**, which may be spent among any number of actions.

The tactical round is played out in 3 phases:
- Initiative,
- Resolution,
- and Upkeep.



### Initiative
`initiative` - determines the order in which combatants resolve their actions.

Base initiative is rolled once at the start of any time-sensitive, tactical situation:

**Base Initiative = 2d10 + Qu - (1 for every -10 penalty)**

**Actual Initiative = Base Initiative + (remaining Action Points x 5)**

Specific actions are declared when they are started, and resolved (e.g., roll a maneuver) when they are completed.

### Resolution

### Upkeep




## Actions
Specific actions are declared when they are started, and resolved (e.g., roll a maneuver) when they are completed.


### parry
The amount of `parry` to be used and who it will be used against must be announced at the beginning of the round, or as soon as melee ensues.
